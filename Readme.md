# Postgres SQl

Main Difference is btw the sql and no sql 
no sql is schemaless additing a new fields and update new new fileds is possible.
in sql if we need to perform addition of a new column we need to do migrations.

### RelationShips.
In nosql we can have a obj in a particular column it is easy also we can search based on that.
In sql those obj is good go with another table for making relatioship and search.
